- Fixed a potential deadlock in the N-Central integration that could cause Immy to hang up
- Fixed some frontend issues where a maintenance action's status and reason would not show correctly for certain values
- Fixed an issue where a terminating exception in a custom download script would get swallowed and allow the install to continue anyway

## 0.54.7

Released 2023-01-04

Added `Split-Path` cmdlet as well as `$ActionId`, `$SessionId` and `$SessionGroupId` to the included variables
- Improved Ephemeral Agent connection speed
- Discontinued use of WMI CreateProcess which flags AV, specifically Windows Defender for Endpoint
- Made modifications to the light color theme to improve readability

## 0.54.3

Released 2022-11-23

### Improvements
---

- Improved enqueueing of maintenance sessions based on priority.  Adhoc > Onboarding > Scheduled maintenance
- Removed service bus form options for CW Control as the service bus is now always used
- Added a health check to the CW Control integration to report unhealthy when the extension is not up to date
- Updated the connected indicator on the computer details page to have a yellow lightning bolt when the ephemeral agent is connected

- Updated the batch actions on the tenant list page to include tenant preferences. e.g. You can now update tenant business hours in bulk
- Clicking "Attempt Identification Again" or "Rety x failed agents" on the identification tab now immediately triggers identification where before it would take up to 60 seconds

### Bug Fixes
---

- Made computer feature usage calculator no longer count computers that have zero agents
- Fixed a race condition in the Ephemeral Agent that would cause scripts to hang and sessions to timeout

## 0.54.2

Released 2022-11-17

### Improvements
---
- Improved our identification de-dupe logic to automatically associate re-installed agents to the correct computers
- Added more identification logs for some edge case scenarios to help with debugging
- Added onboarding text to dashboard underneath onboarding computers
- Slightly improved performance of preview/deploy functionality on the dashboard page
- Increased the width of the tag selector in the ImmyBot Installer form and on the computer details page

## 0.54.1

Released 2022-11-14

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue with CW Control syncs causing CW Control agents to re-sync into ImmyBot unnecessarily

## 0.54.0

Released 2022-11-11

### CW Control Updates
---

We added support for the breaking changes introduced in CW Control 22.9.
We addressed stability issues with Control crashing due to the ImmyBot extension.  On the Control integration form, make sure you check off the new options for using the Service Bus for better performance.

### Pending Identification Updates
---

Agent identification now has logging to help you find root causes for why some agents fail to have scripts run against them. View them in Computers -> Pending Identification -> Show Identification Logs

You can also see the identification logs for successfully identified agents under the Computer -> Agents tab.

We now utilize the serial numbers for devices that come from trusted manufacturers (currently Lenovo, Dell, and HP). If a computer already exists in ImmyBot for a trusted manufacturer, any additional agents with that computer's serial number will skip identification and automatically be associated.

### Improvements
---
- Fixed issue where Intellisense would throw null reference exception when completing variables
- Updated CW Control integration to support CW Control 22.9 (extension version 0.3.0)
- Added immy subscription information to billing details page
- Made subscription portal show within immy frontend instead of a link to chargebee
- Updated the default combined maintenance task script to leverage the latest function scripts in Immy. The new script is `Get-WindowsRegistryValue -Path "HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\MySoftwareVendor\MySoftware" -Name EnableFeature | Registry-ShouldBe -Value 1`
- License files are now downloaded before running a configuration task's test script during detection in case the script relies on the presence of the license file
- Added a new tenant preference "Exclude from Cross-Tenant Deployments and Schedules". When a tenant is excluded, all cross-tenant deployments and schedules targeting the tenant or its computers will not be applied when full maintenance is ran. This is particularly useful for Co-Managed IT situations that don't don't want your cross-tenant schedules or deployments.
- Improved startup time of instances in situations where there was a large number of recently added agents
- Added "Change Tenant" in batch actions for the computers table

## 0.53.12

Released 2022-11-09

### Bug Fixes
---

- Removed the ImmyBot Agent from the Tenant -> Mappings table
- Reduced metric reporter frequency to 30 minutes

## 0.53.11

Released 2022-10-20

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when sending the maintenance session follow-up email
- Fixed a potential exception that could occur in the N-Central API
- Fixed an exception that occurred when trying to retrieve the online agents for a computer
- Fixed an uncommon issue where some dynamic version scripts were throwing a null reference exception
- Fixed an uncommon exception with ImmyBot Agent connection events that caused the event to not get saved
- Fixed an issue with syncing devices from CW Automate where it would potentially take a few minutes and block other requests
- Fixed an issue where some CW Control and N-Central agents were not automatically onboarding when they should
- Fixed issue where `Get-ImmyComputer -InventoryKeys` metascript was not auto populating the available keys
- Fixed an issue with incorrect breadcrumbs sometimes showing on the computer list page
- Added a missing debug log that indicates when an ImmyBot agent fails to provide inventory data
- Fixed a bug where we were dropping both dedupe markers over the same agent instead of different agents
- Fixed an issue with maintenance sessions reporting failed after re-running an action successfully
- Fixed an issue where loading the deployments list would throw a `ArgumentNullException`
- Fixed an issue with some Chocolatey and Ninite logs not showing up under a maintenance action's phases

## 0.53.10

Released 2022-10-05

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue with displaying large software icon sizes on the Library -> Ordering page

## 0.53.9

Released 2022-10-05

### Improvements
---

- SVGs now render correctly when uploaded as software icons
- Increased some low timeout values on the ephemeral agent that were causing devices with slow network connections to fail
- Changed the Pending Identification tab to default sort descending by Date Added since the most recent machines are the ones we are usually looking for.

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue with the ImmyBot Agent connected/disconnected events not propagating for pc reboots and pending connectivity sessions
- Reduced likelyhood of `Output CircularBuffer has already over-run requested index` error in scripts
- Ephemeral Agent reconnection is now prevented upon receiving a 500 status code.  This was previously causing agents to stay running indefinitely.
- Fixed an issue on the system update page where the new releases dropdown was not stretching the width like the current release dropdown

## 0.53.8

Released 2022-9-22

### Improvements
---

- The "Suppress Reboots During Business Hours" flag no longer relies on  offline behavior.  If you are suppressing reboots during business hours and you run a session during business hours, then Immy will suppress reboots.  Business hours are now checked on every script execution, and the `RebootPreference` variable passed to scripts will also be updated to `Suppress` if it was not already set. We did this so that scripts that handle reboots can safely rely on this variable.
- The customer list on the Azure page no longer shows the MSP tenant as a selectable option in the Linked Tenant dropdown since the MSP tenant is mapped by default
- Refactored how we handle ImmyBot agent connected and disconnected events.  Instances that heavily utilize the ImmyBot agent will have significantly improved performance.
- The `Enable Automatic Onboarding` field on the PPKG form is now disabled and shows an alert if the onboarding preference is globally disabled or disabled for the selected tenant.

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue with loading the AzureAD module for metascripts.  This issue was causing all scripts that relied on AzureAD commands to fail.
- Fixed an issue where syncing the connected state of large numbers of ImmyBot agents would prevent other system jobs from being performed
- Fixed an issue where configuration tasks for already compliant software were executing at the very end of a maintenance session instead of in the expected order
- Fixed an issue where the default upgrade strategy was set to none instead of install over
- Fixed a permission issue where non-admins could not refresh the connectivity status of a computer
- Fixed an issue with downloading the ImmyAgent installer as an `.iso` file where the extension was incorrectly set to `.ppkg`
- Fixed an issue where software set to perform an update would incorrectly report compliant when the software did not specify an upgrade strategy and the upgrade was never performed.  The action will now fail and report "Upgrade failed: No Upgrade Strategy specified on the software."
- Fixed an issue with maintenance action execution ordering. If the currently executing action has dependencies, it will now immediately execute the dependencies instead of waiting until the end of the session.
- Fixed an issue with selecting a license on the deployment details page where the selected license was not shown upon refreshing

## 0.53.7

Released 2022-09-14

### Improvements
---

- Increased the timeout of the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method from 1 second to 5 seconds.  1 second was too short and was unnecessarily causing scripts to fail on machines with high network latency.
- Added a warning message whenever the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method takes over 1 second to respond to help identify machines with high network latency

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue with schedules where updating a schedule from a single tenant to cross tenant would delete the schedule. This was happening due to a bug in a database constraint between schedules and tenants.
- Fixed an issue where the connectivity status button on the computer details page was not actually refreshing the agent's connectivity status
- Fixed an issue where repairing a software would trigger full maintenance

## 0.53.6

Released 2022-09-12

### Improvements
---

- Added `Set-ImmyDeviceId` cmdlet to be used during Inventory to keep the UUID of the machine up to date and prevent new computers from getting created when the UUID of the machine has changed due to a feature update.

### Bug Fixes
---

- Fixed an issue where the "Determine Desired Version" phase was running before the "Detect Installed Version" phase. "Detect Installed Version" needs to run first so we can pass the detected version to scripts that may rely on it when determining the desired version.
- Fixed an issue where dynamic versions were not properly installing dependent versions

## 0.53.5

Released 2022-09-09

### Bug Fixes
---

 - Fixed an issue from 0.53.4 where some code changes were unintentionally  included in the release which caused downloading the PPKG to fail

## 0.53.4

Released 2022-09-08

### Improvements
---

- For maintenance task test scripts, we made Immy tolerant of non-Boolean values by displaying a warning when non-Booleans are found on the pipeline along with helper text for preventing output pollution.
- Updated the ImmyBot Agent to support installing beta versions

### Bug Fixes
---
- Fixed a scripting error that caused Immy to indicate there was no output when there was definitely output

## 0.53.3

Released 2022-08-30

### Software Test Script Changes
---

We now execute the software test script during the detection stage for software that have updates available.

**Before**, if a software needed to be upgraded, we would not run the software's test script in detection.  We would perform the upgrade and then run the test script afterwards.  However, if the test failed, the action would fail without any remediation.

**Now**, if a software needs to be upgraded, and it has a test script, the test script will run in detection. If the test script fails, then the repair strategy will be performed instead of the upgrade strategy.  The test script will still be run after the upgrade as it did before.

### General Improvements
---

- Updated the error text for schedule cron expressions to indicate that a schedule can run at most once per day.
- The ImmyBot Agent service sometimes throws an exception about a missing file `CliWrap.dll`, which causes the agent to bork.  When we encounter this exception, we now auto restart the service to resolve the issue.
- Improved the session log message "Detection stage failed: Software Action Id is not specified on the provided configuration task action" to include more information to help diagnose the issue.  It is usually because the deployment contains out-of-date data and needs to be updated.
- Improved the performance of loading the main computer list when sorting by computer name
- Test methods containing multiple outputs now return the result of ANDing those outputs together to compute the overall result.
- Updated Quick Deploy to allow you to choose a desired state. e.g. "Install, Uninstall, Update If Found, Ignore" or "Enforce, Monitor, Audit"
- Added detection of stuck/non-responsive jobs such as the agent identification job, which can initiate a self-restart of backend.
- Added reboot preference dropdown to quick deploy and override forms
- Moved several action columns on tables to the left side for consistency and best compatibility with mobile views.
- Added an option to schedules and adhoc-deplyoments to send detection emails even when all actions are compliant.  This is to allow users whose computers are already up to date to still receive a maintenance email.
- Updated the script list page and session log component to use the Monaco script editor
- Added the CW Automate icon to the main computer list. Clicking the icon opens up the computer in CW Automate.
- Added "Date Added" to the computer list and made it sortable
- Added a simple "new" tag on the computer list for computers that have been added to ImmyBot within the last 24 hours
- Added an 'X' button to easily remove linked tenants from integrations

### Bug Fixes
---

- After a task is created, the `Runs Against` property is now disabled. Changing this value after it is created can cause issues for deployments that are referencing it.
- Fixed an issue with Ephemeral Agent resilient script output logic that would fail to re-connect if the script had never had any output prior to connection loss. (Ex. SonicWall VPN installer script)
- Added missing triggered by text on the session details page when the session was triggered by a schedule or automatic onboarding
- Fixed a width issue on some dropdown buttons
- Fixed an issue with the integration client list re-sorting after you link/unlink a tenant

## 0.53.2

Released 2022-08-19

### Bug Fixes
---
- Fixed an error that showed on the schedules list when a schedule existed that did not specify a time zone
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the current immy version stopped displaying in the sidebar
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the maintenance item ordering page broke
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where showing/adding parameters on the maintenance task page broke
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were only showing the last line of output instead of all output
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were overflowing into other components
- Fixed an issue where re-running actions while showing action details would not displaying logs as they came in
- Fixed an issue introduced for instances that signed up after the release of 0.53.0 where identification would fail due to some missing database configurations

## 0.53.1 (un-published)

Released 2022-08-18

### Improvements
---
- Added a `Trigger Now` button to the Azure User Sync preference on the preferences page
- Added a description to the PPKG reset windows checkbox - "Will perform a reset of windows with the remove user data option"

### Bug Fixes
---
- Fixed an issue with agent identification where users were seeing the following error - `Failed attempt to differentiate existing agent and pending agent: 42883: procedure sp_create_computer_from_agent(integer, uuid, boolean, text, text, text, unknown, boolean) does not exist POSITION: 6`
- Updated the alert of the person list page to match the available actions
- Fixed an issue where the software configuration task edit link was missing
- Fixed an issue where the branding logo alt text was still hardcoded to "Immense Networks" instead of the value provided by the branding
- Fixed an issue with cancelling a detection only session from the computer details page -> software tab.

- Fixed an issue with the Automate integration where we were unable to retrieve more than 50 Windows patches
- ImmyAgent now handles exceptions returned from an instance during registration, and will continually retry instead of shutting down.
- Fixed a typo in the SMTP port placeholder text
- Fixed an issue with quick assign not setting the correct desired state when running the detection only session
- Fixed an issue with checking online/offline status of agents during a session

## 0.52.7

Released 2022-07-11

### Improvements

---

- The script list page now persists your filters after refreshing or leaving the page.
- Fixed width issues in the maintenance item column on the deployment list page
- Reduced required permissions for N-Central integration. See [the new N-Central integration docs](https://docs.immy.bot/ncentral-integration-setup.html) for details
- Added a new PowerShell cmdlet `Stop-ImmySession` that will cancel the maintenance session it is currently running in

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed some potential issues around agent connected/disconnected events
- Fixed potential N-Central exception with re-sending messages
- Fixed potential issue with 'missing' devices from N-Central due to possible filter contamination in N-Central

## 0.52.6

Released 2022-06-27

### Improvements

---

- Set the default install script for new software to the "Manual Install Script" and the upgrade strategy to "Install Over" whenever we don't have another specific install script to provide
- Set the default software installer type to "Installer File"
- Updated the example New-DynamicVersion script
- We now show a confirmation modal when choosing the "Wiped" option for resolving an agent identification conflict.
- You can now see Cloud Sessions from the main Sessions list!
- Added warnings when the ephemeral agent is failing to establish a connection to help users identify causes for failing script execution
- Fixed an issue with the detection stage stuck running when it fails to execute scripts in the beginning of the stage
- Improved timeline connected/disconnected events. There were edge cases that would show multiple connects/disconnects back to back.
- Removed timeline computer online/offline events to avoid confusion. These events were never actually based on a computer coming online or going offline. We simply emitted "online" when an agent connected and happened to be the only online agent. Similarly for "offline" events, we only emitted the event when an agent disconnected and all agents were offline. ImmyBot does not actively check whether a machine is online or offline. It only checks whether it has any connected agents to use. This concept will be further improved upon to help resolve issues with agents incorrectly reporting connected/disconnected.
- Removed link to software/task on deployment list since people are clicking it thinking it is the edit deployment link
- Moved the software/task selector back above the target selector on the deployment edit page
- Removed the media nav item since it's not actually useful

### Bug Fixes

---

- Moved "Update If Found" from underneath "Installed" to the same level as "Installed" for clarity. A software can be "installed, uninstalled, ignored, or updated if found"
- Fixed an issue with cloud task previews failing with "device offline"
- Fixed an issue where the ImmyBot agent update action would not run when the agent was offline
- Fixed an issue with the agent updates stage, onboarding stage, and resolution stage not honoring pending connectivity
- Fixed an issue where the resume and cancel session buttons were incorrectly showing for postponed sessions
- Fixed an issue with CW Control and CW Automate health error messages excluding important details that can help diagnose the problem
- Fixed an issue where we were not checking if a configuration task is actually marked as a configuration task. This resulted in tasks getting run when they should not have.

## 0.52.5

Released 2022-06-13

### N-Central Beta Updates

---

- Fixed an issue with exceptions that may occur inside the N-Central device-sync job causing memory to bloat
- You can now get registration tokens from the NCentral integration via new PSCmdlet `Get-NCentralRegistrationToken`

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/501dd3bc-d823-40a0-a307-000ec5185e6a)

### Other Improvements

---

- Under "Preferences", the description of the User Affinity Sync feature says it will run every 4 hours; this is incorrect. Verbiage was changed to indicate it will run every 24 hours.
- On the integration details page, a confirmation modal has been added when clicking the "Bulk create tenants..." button to prepare users that this will cause code execution for linked clients.
- Added more improvements to online/offline agent handling during maintenance sessions
- Updated the online/offline event receiver for CW Control to return immediately in an effort to close requests faster

## 0.52.4

Released 2022-05-31

### Improvements

---

- Removed unnecessary checkboxes from the Computers table on the "Edit Schedule" page
- Immy live chat now supports screenshare! Immy support can now request access to view your screen to help resolve issues faster.

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue with the maintenance email actions requiring authentication

## 0.52.3

Released 2022-05-27

### Improvements

---

- ImmyAgents no longer need to see a valid board serial number in order to complete registration or rekey. Instead, ImmyAgent may fall back on and rely on an 'ImmyHWID' (Immy hardware id), when a board serial is not available. ImmyHWIDs are derived from CPU, BIOS, MOBO, GPU, and TPM information where available.
- Updated maintenance sessions to listen on agent connected/disconnected events instead of computer online/offline events which have faster responses and higher success rates
- When a new agent comes into ImmyBot, we now kick off the identification job immediately if it isn't already running in an effort to speed up identification
- Added session logs for dependencies indicating what they are for. e.g. `Software A depends on Software B → If not installed then install`.
- The actions in the maintenance email (Reboot Now, Update Now, and Postpone), now link to a form on the ImmyBot instance instead of linking directly to the backend api. The reason for this is because some spam filters will automatically follow links in an email, which has accidentally caused computer reboots. Moving the link to a form allows spam filters to no longer be able to trigger the action automatically.

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue causing the computer details page to sometimes not load
- Fixed an issue with the ImmyAgent rekey request not being received
- Fixed an issue where `Get-ImmyComputer` was incorrectly reporting offline
- Fixed an issue where configuration file parameters were not being downloaded when the configuration task did not have any enabled scripts
- Fixed an issue with displaying the dependency badges on maintenance actions
- Fixed an issue with the schedule's day of week selector cutting off the last characters of "Wednesday"
- Fixed an issue with the CompareTo-ImmyBotVersion metascript
- Fixed an issue with some maintenance action start times showing "2021 years ago" instead of "Unavailable" when the action never started
- Bump Azure IoTHub packages to resolve some connection issues with the ImmyAgent

## 0.52.2

Released 2022-05-25

### Ephemeral Agent and Identification Improvements

---

- **ALL** scripts now run through the ephemeral agent, even during identification and computer de-dupe logic 🎉
- Additional exception information is now visible in Identification Failed tab, and in session output. This furthers insight for users to understand and fix potential reasons why the providers may have failed to run our agent.
  ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22b9d763-3a43-4403-8c01-70e020e3a303)
- Fixed an issue where the date was not being set correctly when adding a AgentIdentificationFailure log, leading the user to think this issue happened at the beginning of time!

### Onboarding Deployments

---

The **Onboarding** target type has been moved to a separate checkbox so that you can limit deployments to onboarding only AND use the target type filters.

### ImmyAgent Improvements

---

Updated internal infrastructure to utilize our new [extended verification code-signing certificate](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates#EV-Code-Signing).

We currently sign:

1. ImmyAgent executable & MSI/EXE/PPKG Installers
2. Ephemeral Agent executable
3. Static PoSH run on computers

In addition to being more secure, this ensures our software is no-longer flagged by SmartScreen.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Customers utilizing software such as ThreatLocker _MUST_ ensure our new certificate is whitelisted, as our new EV cert required "LLC" to be present on our CN and O.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/40220de1-d9f9-48fb-a39e-ebb791bd19fe)

- Fixed some performance issues and improved caching of function scripts

## 0.50.7

Released 2022-02-25

### Maintenance Task Serial Execution

---

A maintenance task now has the option to "Execute Serially".

When checked, this maintenance task is guaranteed to only have one instance active at a time.

e.g. If three maintenance sessions have an action for a maintenance task that executes serially, then one session will execute the maintenance task while the other two wait for it to complete. Once the first completes, the second will execute. Once the second completes, the third will execute.

This is useful for maintenance tasks that rely on the state of subsequent executions.

### Other Improvements

---

- Added a `Status` and `Types` column to the CW Manage client list on the integration details page so you can easily filter your list to clients you want to create tenants for. Also made the `Linked Tenants` column filterable to "Linked" or "Not linked". The `Bulk create tenants for unassigned clients` is now `Bulk create tenants for filtered unassigned clients` and will only bulk create tenants for those visible rows matching the table filters.
- Added checks to ensure that the identification job is running properly

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an error that was preventing the computer overview page from loading
- Fixed an issue with scripts running multiple times if you opened, closed, and re-opened a script editor
- Fixed issues with the CW Control integration not updating the device name, os name, and serial number of the agent

## 0.49.0

Released 2022-01-11

### Improved Performance

---

In this release, codenamed "Cheetah" we achieved a **20x** improvement in script execution performance through the use of WebSockets, Named Pipes, and removing code that is no longer necessary since the introduction of the Ephemeral Agent.

We also made restarting machines faster by using the new event driven Wait-ImmyComputer cmdlet when waiting for computers to reconnect after a reboot.

### Apply on Connect

---

#### Problem to solve

Computers that are offline never receive maintenance. These computers need a way to update when they miss their maintenance window.

#### Solution

You can now specify the offline behavior for computers on schedules and ad-hoc deployments.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a720eb9f-74b7-4a9d-935e-4fb0cbe6ace1)

When offline behavior is set to `Apply On Connect`, a session will get marked as ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/5df28983-4e9d-455c-b1b3-21a8638b6e6a) when the device is offline. When the device comes online, the session will resume.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e6b38fd2-0370-4e09-b75d-527867cfeedd)

Since devices can come online at anytime, the option to `Suppress Reboots During Business Hours` is checked by default.

If a device is offline before the detection stage, then it will run the detection stage when it comes online.

If a device is offline before the execution stage, then it will only run the execution stage when it comes online. It will not re-run detection.

Maintenance emails are only sent out once regardless if the device goes offline.

### Timeline

---

On the computer details overview tab, there is now a section called Timeline that
shows particular events that have occurred for the computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/90b4b265-8744-44cb-b3ce-47c2bd6ec0e0)

The events we are currently showing are:

1. Agent disconnected
1. Agent connected
1. Maintenance action started (only shows if the action required execution)
1. Maintenance action completed (only shows if the action required execution)

More events will be added in the future.

### Other Improvements

---

- Improved performance of determining desired state of deployments during maintenance
- Improved performance of some update queries
- Added a new metascript cmdlet `Wait-ImmyComputer` that returns as soon as a computer has connectivity
- Added & Updated Ephemeral Agent connection statistics in 'System Status' page to report data/data-rate metrics about the underlying Ephemeral Agent connection to the backend

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue where software download scripts were timing out after 60 seconds if the script didn't specify its own timeout
- Fixed an issue where changes made to a configuration task parameters from the software page were not saving
- Fixed issues displaying incorrect text in the target type column on the deployment and schedule list pages
- Fixed a bug where you could not remove a software download script
- Fixed a bug with `Add-UriQueryParameter` where it did not accept array values or parse existing parameters
- Fixed an issue with Ephemeral Agent "end-of-stream" response exceptions resulting in termination of stage
- Fixed various issues with agent connection events and improved performance
- Fixed an issue where immy agent registrations could cause resource depletion in the backend's IoT service
- Fixed the timezone selector to show the region to differentiate the options
- Fixed a bug where dynamic versions could depend on itself and cause an infinite loop

## 0.48.7

Released 2021-12-10

### Access Requests

---

Your users and the ImmyBot support team can now request access to your instance! When an unauthorized person authenticates, a "Request Access" button is available that will submit an access request. An MSP user can then grant or deny access from the user list page. An expiration of one hour, one day, or never can be set for the user.

The access request feature can be enabled/disabled on the preferences page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/bb34184f-c7c3-41cf-9fa3-f6489e6c3600)

- Improved the readability of the Azure page
- Added an alert to the user page about creating new users
- Replaced references to "Immybot" with "ImmyBot"

## 0.48.0

Released 2021-11-29

### IMPORTANT

---

#### **The changes in this release will require reconsent at first login!**

**ⓘ If your Azure AD is configured to not allow non-Admin users to consent to new apps, you will need to login once as a user with sufficient privileges.**

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/4aebeec7-2bcf-414f-952e-272e3deaffc5)

- Consolidated backend and frontend into a single Enterprise Application (Service Principal)
- Removed `backend.subdomain.immy.bot` and pointed all API calls to `subdomain.immy.bot`
  - This has the additional benefit of increasing performance as the browser no longer makes a CORS pre-flight check when hitting the API
    - Note: If you are using the ImmyBot API, you will need to remove `backend.` from your URI

## 0.47.12

Released 2021-11-29

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.47.11 where BITS downloads fail for files that do not specify an MD5 hash

## 0.47.11

Released 2021-11-24

### Improvements

---

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed Ephemeral Agent PowerShell execution failures on some machines
- Fixed an issue with nested exceptions not showing the correct output

## 0.47.10

Released 2021-11-23

### Improvements

---

- Ephemeral Agent EXE respects global proxies for https:// even though it uses wss://

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed issue where Ephemeral Agent EXE failed to launch due to an extraction issue on Windows Server Core

## 0.47.9

Released 2021-11-22

### Bug Fixes

---

1. Fixed an issue with inventory and script-run cancellation logic causing high memory usage
1. Fixed an issue with function scripts being used in metascripts causing heavy load on global database
1. Switched to force Ephemeral Agent EXE to utilize System Proxy settings to alleviate connection refusal for some users
1. Fixed an issue with PowerShell execution occasionally throwing an error that would crash ImmyBot

## 0.47.8

Released 2021-11-17

### Features

#### Ephemeral Agent EXE

1. The ephemeral agent now executes as an `.exe` instead of a PowerShell script.
1. This allows us to use a WebSocket instead of polling, which improves performance and resiliency as we can immediately detect disconnections.
1. Decreased initial connection time by attempting to connect using all RMMs simultaneously instead of in sequence.
1. Substantially improved logging to help troubleshoot script execution issues

**Note: You may have to exclude your instance's hostname in the firewall from SSL Inspection policies! SSL Inspection may interfere with the WebSocket connection from this new agent!**

**Note: You may also need to adjust your security software to allow the EXE to execute. We recommend adding an exclusion for the Immense Networks code signing certificate as it will be used to sign all ImmyBot PowerShell scripts and Executables.**

The subject of the certificate is:

```
CN=Immense Networks, O=Immense Networks, L=Baton Rouge, S=Louisiana, C=US
```

### Improvements

- Inventory scripts now run in parallel
- ImmyBot will always overwrite license files to prevent issues with software not activating because the previous license file is still in the ImmyBot download folder.
- The script terminal on the computer details page is no longer cleared when swapping between tabs.
- Updated the instance disabled text to specify that only an admin user can re-enable immy

### Bug Fixes

- The EXE ephemeral agent addresses intermittent ScriptTimeout exceptions that would occur for a variety of reasons
- Implemented a "Script Execution Circuit Breaker" per computer to prevent RMM overload when retrying ephemeral connections (This can happen when security software blocks execution or firewalls prevent outbound connections)
- Fixed several issues around script error handling. Line numbers now display correctly. Exceptions that occur before running a script are now caught and displayed properly.
- Fixed an issue where inventory output with a value of `null` was being treated as successful and overwriting good results
- Fixed a bug with session logs showing null references when a script was cancelled or timed out
- Fixed a bug with quick deploy where the deployment resolution stage was unnecessarily reaching out to the computer to retrieve its software
- Fixed a bug during maintenance sessions, `Field at index '1' does not exist...`, where retrieving the list of installed chocolatey software would fail
- Resolved a potential issue around re-acquiring ephemeral agent sessions under concurrent script execution scenarios
- Fixed a bug when re-authenticating to ImmyBot where you wouldn't be redirected to the page you were previously on due to the URL not including query parameters

## 0.47.0

Released 2021-10-28

### Maintenance Execution Order

---

You can now specify the order in which maintenance items are executed by navigating to "/deployments/ordering" or by clicking the "Ordering" link in the side nav bar under "Deployments".

![Maintenance Execution Order](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/itemorderingscreenshot.png)

### Other Improvements

---

- Made some internal improvements to how we store core PowerShell code that will make development and script signing easier
- Allowed dynamic version software to use the "Update If Found" desired state
- Allowed inventory to use metascripts
- Parallelized inventory to run up to 4 scripts in parallel for faster execution
- When creating scripts from a software or maintenance task, the script name will now have a default value. E.g. If creating a new installation script the default name will be " Installation Script" made in this MR for use in release notes
- Added a maintenance item column to the schedule list page
- Simplified the "Getting Started Wizard"
- Removed unnecessary padding in the "Getting Started Wizard"
- New instances will now automatically approve all recommended target assignments

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed a bug with adding the CW Automate integration where it would throw an error if the list of clients being imported was extremely large
- Fixed command-line scripts so uninstall logic works as expected
- Updated the target assignment resolution to exclude assignments that are tied to disabled provider links
- Fixed a bug where the test script on a software was not getting called if the software was detected
- Fixed a bug with maintenance item ordering where the preferred initial order of recommended items was not being set
- Fixed an issue that was causing a memory leak that scaled with the number of ImmyBot agent installers

## 0.46.9

Released 2021-10-04

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed a bug where configuration tasks were failing with `"Parameter '<parameter name>' is marked required for Maintenance Task...and no value has been set"` when the parameter value was actually set

## 0.46.8

Released 2021-09-30

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed a bug with maintenance tasks where the default parameter value was being used instead of the overridden value

- Fixed a bug with running user context scripts where an error was being swallowed and the scripts would inevitably time out
- Fixed an issue with updating the "Installer Executable Path / Installer File" field on the software version form where it would revert to the previous value
- Fixed a bug where software marked as "Download Only" would attempt to run its configuration task. Software that is set to download only no longer adds an action for its configuration task.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the azure user sync to stop running. When it encounters an issue syncing a specific tenant, it will now log some details that will help the immy team determine why it is failing and then continue attempting to sync other tenants.
- Fixed a bug with running `Get-AgentInstallScript` where it would return the error `Tenant # is not linked to a client for the specified provider`
- Fixed a bug saving the onboarding form where we were not disabling the onboarding save buttons while the page was still loading. Attempting to to save before the page was loaded was causing an error to be thrown
- Fixed a bug where the branding list was showing brandings as "Expired" when they actually weren't
- Fixed a bug where updating brandings with no selected tenant would cause the branding to get deleted instead
- Fixed a bug where using the "Re-inventory" button on the computer details page would often time out and show an error

- Fixed potential issues with scripts not getting ran by prefixing our scripts with, `[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;`
- Removed "Powered by Immense Networks" from the footer of maintenance emails
- Fixed a bug where after uploading and analyzing software, the analyzed upgrade code was not executing the search to see if it was found on existing machines
- Fixed a bug on the computer list page where a computer's online status was considering disabled links. Since a disabled link can result in stale data, we no longer use them to determine the online status of a computer.
- Fixed a bug with clicking the "Delete Offline Agent" button on the computer agents tab
- Fixed a bug where default configuration task parameters were missing when deploying from the computer software tab
- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when attempting to run a script against an offline computer

---

- Fixed a bug in deserializing data that resulted in `The requested operation requires an element of type 'Number', but the target element has type 'String'.`
- Fixed a potential null reference exception when retrieving bulk software

## 0.46.2

Released 2021-09-15

### Improvements

---

- Changed ImmyAgent to use callbacks internally to response to Ephemeral Agent script start events. This should improve issues where the Ephemeral Agent doesn't start when using the ImmyAgent
- Added a new switch parameter to `Invoke-ImmyCommand` called `-IncludeLocals`, which will automatically include all variables from the metascript runspace. When using `-IncludeLocals` you no longer need to specify $using variables.

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue where system scripts timeouts were not being honored
- Fixed backwards-compatibility of `Get-RmmInfo`and `Get-RmmComputer` metascripts
- Fixed an issue with automate groups not loading on deployment form

- Fixed a bug with `Invoke-ImmyCommand` where $using variables were throwing a warning: `WARNING: Parameter '__using_command' already exists with value "some-value"`
- Fixed a regression where `Get-RmmInstallScript` was renamed to `Get-AgentInstallscript`. `Get-RmmInstallScript` is now an alias for `Get-AgentInstallScript`

## 0.46.1

Released 2021-09-14

### Bug Fixes

---

Fix ImmyAgent bug which would cause Temp PS1 path to not be created.

## 0.46.0

Released 2021-09-14

### Ephemeral Agent Script Execution

---

ImmyBot now uses "Ephemeral Agents" for script execution.

This new method will normalize the time it takes to run scripts across all RMM Providers. The initial payload to start the ephemeral agent will be sent through the RMM, but then all subsequent scripts will communicate directly with the ephemeral agent.

An Ephemeral Agent is a lightweight PowerShell script that establishes a direct connection with the ImmyBot backend via Polling or SSE (Server-Sent Events) to receive script payloads to execute. Script output is then sent through an Azure Service Bus for high throughput handling. The ImmyBot backend manages the lifetime of ephemeral agents and is able to re-use them efficiently.

### Script Path Preference

---

It is now easier to whitelist ImmyBot in your Antivirus. The Ephemeral Agent will use a script path containing a hash unique to your instance that you can rekey yourself.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e29c58d2-d877-430c-b1b3-6035e855038e)

### Default Software Scripts

---

You can now specify install, uninstall, post-install, post-uninstall, upgrade, and test scripts directly on the software.

This reduces duplication for software where the versions use the same exact scripts while also making software easier to manage.

**Considerations**

1. If the software has a script and the desired version has a script, then the script on the version takes precedence. (e.g. the version's install script will be used instead of the software's install script if both are present)
1. If the version does not have a script, then we will attempt to use the one on the software if the script is present.

### Custom Download Script

---

You can now assign a "Download Installer" script to software that will be used instead of the core Immy download installer logic. This is valuable when downloading 3rd party installers from URLs that require authentication or specific headers.

### Other Improvements

---

- Combined RMM Links and PSA Links into a single Integrations page under Settings
- Improved Tarma InstallMate package analyzer detection
- Added documentation for Ephemeral Agent & ServiceBus Script-Result handler info tiles in System Status page to better explain what they mean, and how to discern specific pieces of information from them
- Fixed an issue where password parameters with `$` characters were getting stripped
  ServiceBus Script-Result handling & Ephemeral Agent sessions are enabled by default for new Instances
- Integration type capabilities are now listed on the New Integration page
- ServiceBus Script-Result handling can now process results at a much higher throughput & more reliably than before.
- ServiceBus Result latency has been improved to around ~100ms under normal load conditions from ~3s.
- Implemented caching for tenant preferences to reduce database calls during maintenance sessions
- Reduced some complexity in how we structure RMM Links and PSA Links (now known as integrations)
- Reworded script-start-failed log to not include integration link name since the integration is not responsible for starting the scripts
- Added basic logging of inventory script names and any errors to session logs

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue where linking a tenant to an RMM client was incorrectly pushing the synced computers to Needs Onboarding. Computers synced by linking a tenant are automatically marked as onboarding since it is the initial sync.
- Fixed an issue with creating deployments where the maintenance item search was not returning maintenance tasks with the Tenant Category
- Added a session log to warn users when you attempt to run a cloud script (tenants only) against a computer. This shouldn't be possible, but there is a bug on the deployment form that is allowing you to save an invalid deployment. This bug will be fixed in an upcoming release
- Updated the Azure CSP Preconsent instructions on https://docs.immy.bot/guide/csp-preconsent-instructions.html to reflect the latest UI.

### Quick Deploy

---

Deploying software for a specific computer is now easier. Located at the top of the Software tab on the computer details page. Tell your techs to use this form if they need to deploy software to a specific computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/c70b0628-847b-40b6-99db-456f69ce5115)

After selecting a software / maintenance task that you want to deploy, a session will be kicked off to determine if the computer has any applicable deployments. If a deployment is found, then you'll be presented actions for that deployment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/87d9a5a0-0f1d-41ea-94ba-8868fbe674f5)

If a deployment is not found, then you are asked if you would like to create one.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e268d0b8-2538-4019-bbe3-492468f162d8)

If the selected item requires configuration task parameter values or a license, then you still need to create the deployment from the traditional deployment page. We plan on expanding on this to allow supplying a license and parameters directly on this form.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/f351d75d-738e-4acb-9588-3103842fcda4)

### Computer List Search Improvements

---

Searching for computers is now much faster after some internal refactoring of how the data was stored. We removed the need to select a filter so you can now search by any of the available fields specified in the placeholder.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ae56632e-651a-4e41-8f4d-0f62d6947f47)

- Added `Onboarding` as a support Target Type for convience.
- Made device inventory storage processes more efficient and started caching some often-accessed computer data (like computer names)

### Download ImmyBot Agent Installer Improvements

---

Updated the interface for downloading an immy agent installer. You can now assign default behavior to any of the installation methods. The `Deploy` tab will now automatically update when your computer shows up in ImmyBot.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7ab85162-0ce8-49bd-ab16-a76a6c105dab)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/b16dcf31-9e06-4f09-818f-bfff57c19f0f)

### Inventory Results over Service Bus (Beta)

---

Inventory scripts sent over any Rmm Provider connection will have their results sent over an Azure ServiceBus connection. This allows us to stream results in real-time, eliminating message size constraints. Since this is a new feature, you must manually enable this functionality under preferences. In a later release, we will extend the service bus script result handling to all scripts ran through Immy

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/39e9a698-cff7-4db5-af1d-d34dd0b74c64)

- Fixed some issues with the agent update stage

## 0.43.0

Released 2021-06-01

### Agent Updating

---

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a6a6cdbb-f45e-4b95-91a9-e4272979527c)

### Assignment Override

---

As part of a refactor of the computer software tab, we added the ability to override assignments. This is useful when resolving one off computers that do not need to be part of a larger assignment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0a02d6ac-21f5-425d-8ab7-1b881d7d16f2)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e24d1489-c7fa-46ed-bde9-8a9bde0df04f)

### Recommended Deployments

---

A recommended deployment is a global deployment that is accessible to all ImmyBot users. Recommended deployments represent common scenarios that most companies use. You can approve / dismiss recommended deployments. Approving a deployment will allow it to be considered as a valid deployment when running maintenance. Dismissing a deployment will disallow it from being considered during maintenance.

When a new recommended deployment is added, you will receive a notification, "You have new recommended deployments". Clicking this link will prompt you to approve / disapprove the deployment.

You can manage the approval of all recommended deployments from the main Deployment List page by clicking the "View Recommended Deployments" button at the top.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/479a8f6b-14b1-45c6-a5d5-97d9fd8a6d04)

  - The Provisioning Package now embeds the MSI instead of downloading it, preventing the need for an internet
- ImmyAgent Service is now a single exe file
- ImmyAgent gracefully shuts down quickly preventing connection errors on service restart because the previous process is still running
- Better online/offline tracking: ImmyAgent now sends messages to the backend to indicate when it connects and disconnects. The prevents issues where a restart may not be noticed on machines that reboot quickly because the IoTHub filters out connection events that happen quickly.
- When joining the domain from the Onboarding screen, the logs indicate what domain controller is being used to fetch the offline domain join token
- When scripts are running in the Metascript context, we say execution is happening in the ImmyBot Backend instead of 'Server' as it could be confused with a server managed by ImmyBot

### Bug Fixes

---

### Software Providers

---

#### What is a Software Provider?

A Software Provider tells ImmyBot how to install/uninstall a software. Currently, Local, Global, Chocolatey and Ninite are supported as providers. You can assign the available providers to a software on the software's edit page. A local/global software will inherently be a Local/Global Provider if there are software versions present.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/a54835ec-7977-48f4-85c6-b9cce0f53c5f)

The provider that is used during a maintenance session can be specified on the deployment. For example, if the Chocolatey provider is added on a software and is selected on a deployment, then Immy will always attempt to install/uninstall the software through Chocolatey.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2ee5c1c5-0011-4f82-bb9b-983b4aafffcb)

If a specific provider is not selected, then the software will be installed/uninstalled using the following logic:

1. If the deployment is set to install the latest version or update if found, then the provider that contains the latest software version will be used.
   - e.g. If chocolatey has a newer software version then global, then chocolatey will be used.
1. For any other desired state, the local/global provider will be used (normal behavior).

If the Ninite integration is enabled and Ninite is set as an alternate provider, then Ninite will take priority over Local/Global and Chocolatey.

### Detection Outdated

---

Added a flag to computers to indicate that a deployment for the computer has been updated and that detection should be re-run to ensure the computer is up to date.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/1fbec2a1-cf19-402a-8118-4596c3d835dd)

### Computer Software Page Updates

---

Added more tabs to filter the computer's software list

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f25f22c-ab5d-4d7b-8ebd-db40321d6718)

#### Unassignable

The unassignable tab lists all software that exist on the computer but does not exist in ImmyBot as managed Software.

#### Assignable

The assignable tab now has two potential actions: **Quick Assign** and **Assign**. Quick Assign will immediately create a deployment targeting the primary person (if present) or the computer. A detection only session will also start immediately to determine the current state of the software. Assign will open the New Deployment Page and allow you to create a new assignment for the software. Quick assign is currently only available for software that do not have a configuration task or a license.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/396d2451-2e36-4793-b63f-99ed514bd536)

#### Assigned

The assigned tab now provides 3 potential actions: **Action to take (Install, Update, Enforce, etc)**, **Re-run detection (refresh icon)**, and **Manage (edit deployment)**"

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/016316a8-470a-42e8-a57a-b2c79ebb512f)

### Configuration Tasks

---

Added better support for Software Configuration Tasks by allowing a maintenance task to be checked off as a Configuration Task.

Configuration Tasks are used to provide parameters to software install scripts and/or provide additional configuration after the software is installed. Checking this box allows you to select this Maintenance Task from the Configuration Task section of the 'Edit Software' page. Configuration Tasks are not select-able on the 'Edit Deployment' Page to prevent accidental deployment without the associated software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ec4caad0-653c-47e1-9ed3-4cc465e62e2e)

The Configuration Task selector on the Software Edit Page now only show maintenance tasks that have Configuration Task checked.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/635573a1-b763-400c-b9f8-c2328b1f60c4)

The Maintenance Item selector in the Edit Deployment Screen will push Software and Maintenance Tasks marked as recommended to the top of the list, making it easier to disambiguate packages that exist in multiple repositories.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/d930984c-6bea-437e-a943-1401b88a3ad9)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e73663be-9474-49b0-bb15-859bc298a554)

Added new filters to the top of the software list page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/040c029c-a56a-49a7-a1bd-55b65ba211dc)

Added new filters to the top of the maintenance task list page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9a226551-a7f5-434a-9224-20abcb4b5889)

### Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

- Fixed issue with previewing offline computers on the deployment page

## 0.41.0

Released 2021-03-23

### Software Icons

QOL feature where we added the ability to upload icons to software that can be displayed in software lists.

We will incrementally start adding icons to Global Software and displaying the icons on various pages where software are shown, such as the Dashboard and Maintenance Session Details pages.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/87ac591e-eba5-401f-b80d-850940b3e5ca)

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/252f3f9b-2927-472f-9790-defb29ff0188)

#### Media

---

ImmyBot now officially supports uploading media that can be used in Maintenance Tasks as file parameters. Existing media can now be selected from the media library for re-use on multiple maintenance tasks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/fd69024e-cbf5-4940-8dfa-b42c25c7e886)

#### Detection Only Maintenance Sessions

---

Detection only maintenance sessions are replacing the "Preview" feature where we determine what needs to be done for a computer to be compliant without actually enforcing compliance. The benefit over the old "preview" is that detection only maintenance sessions will persist to the database.

A detection only session will gather all deployments for a computer, and if the computer is online, it will then run detection to determine compliance. If the computer is offline, it will only determine what the desired state is.

#### Additional computer software list filtering

---

Added additional filtering to the computer's software list that allows you to filter by managed software, inventoried software, or both. Also, a toggle to show "Hidden Items" was added to show or hide system component inventoried software.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0e0cc80d-3e40-496b-aace-fcf3025f38d4)

#### Max session indicator

---

Updated the Sessions List page headers to show Created Sessions and the max number of running sessions Immy can run concurrently.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/3f27e7c1-89aa-4caf-8654-677be3f9297e)

## 0.40.2

Released 2021-03-08

### Azure Improvements

----Added the ability to create tenants from your Azure Customers from the Azure page. This is convenient for those only using the ImmyBot Agent, and want to quickly create tenants from their Azure Customers. We also added the Azure Customer Domain to the table since this may be valuable to see.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22e52fe4-1739-49e3-b624-d3cd307be64b)

### Chocolatey Improvements

---

Our managed server that proxies and caches Chocolatey requests can at times be unreliable. Also, this server is not geographically replicated so it is not the best solution for those using ImmyBot outside of the US. We added logic that automatically falls back to using Chocolatey directly whenever our managed server is responding poorly. We also improved our caching which resulted in better response times and fewer requests sent to Chocolatey.

### Script Session Logs Improvements

---

Updated the styling of script session logs. Clicking "Open Debugger" now copies the script output to the terminal.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0681edc0-c106-4e2c-8ed9-649cd7fe3473)

### Schedule Improvements

---

The default detection time for new schedules has been changed to 2PM. The default execution time for new schedules has been changed to 10PM. Extra details were added to detection and execution time descriptions on new schedule form.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8f1f906f-4e21-4f16-998e-32f4563f600d)

### Deployment Improvements

---

Deployment options more clearly indicate that they will only affect sessions created on the deployment page and will not be saved with the deployment itself.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/dae05886-dc34-46fb-871a-582992fc75fa)

### Bug Fixes

---

- Fixed an issue with the software auto update method `Add-SoftwareVersion` where it would not accept valid versions.
- Fixed an issue in Firefox where clicking inside the "Download ImmyBot Agent Installer" dropdown closed the dropdown
- Fixed issues in computer software list where local and global software/tasks did not have links
- Fixed an issue with displaying emails in the iPhone mail app, where the body of the email was very small
- Fixed a bug during renaming a computer where it would still attempt the rename even if the computer already had the desired name

### Added PPKG option to disable hibernation

Set to true by default.

### Schedule specific maintenance items alert message

---

Added an alert message on the schedule details page to better clarify why some computers may not have maintenance sessions started.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7d7ccc18-bb2b-49b1-9032-3bf74ab3192d)

### Improved Custom Detection Script logic

---

Custom Detection Scripts can now return any output as long as the last word is a valid semantic version.

#### Example

```powershell
write-output "The version found is 1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
write-output "Version:`n`n1.0.0" ## translates to a detected version of 1.0.0
```

### Bug Fixes

---

1. Fixed issues with setting appropriate fields when the analyzer returns data for an uploaded software
1. Fixed an issue where new computers were not getting moved to onboarding after being identified if the computer already existed.
1. Fixed an issue when re-installing with the uninstall/install method, where the installer failed to downloaded and left the software uninstalled
1. Replaced the word "undetermined" in Immy emails with a blank
1. Fixes an issue displaying output logs for cloud scripts on the deployment page
1. Fixed configuration task search not using case-insensitive searching.

1. Fixed a bug where the view software buttons on the Software List Page were missing
1. Fixed an issue with software version test script logic that was triggering a re-install when the test script did not explicitly return `false`. Test scripts must now explicitly return `false` in order to trigger a re-install. Returning `null`, `""`, and `0` will not trigger a re-install.
1. Enabled the metascript execution context for custom detection scripts
1. Removed the "all scripts are disabled for task" alert on the deployment form for configuration tasks
1. Fixed a bug on the deployment form where it would not let you save if you changed the selected maintenance item from one software to another
1. Fixed a bug on the deployment form where it would not keep your selected desired state when changing the selected maintenance item from one software to another
1. Fixed a bug preventing the logout button from working

## 0.40.0

Released 2021-02-24

#### Dashboard Page

---

Added a new page that can provide you the latest actions for software and maintenance tasks that were run against a group of computers. The page is intended to help produce audits and show whether or not computers are compliant. This page is a work in progress and will be iterated on over the next few weeks.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/7a0c32f8-3011-450a-94a1-2633b6a65c09)

##### How to use it

1. Select a target scope for the computers you are interested in.
1. Select one or more software or maintenance tasks
1. The table will then show you a green check, a red x, or nothing to indicate the compliance of the selected item for that computer
   - A green check indicates that the latest action for the item is compliant.
   - A red x indicates that the latest action for the item is not compliant.
   - Nothing indicates that ImmyBot has not run an action against the computer for the item.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22f43392-98f8-42f5-9923-4ef171a657f5)

- You can filter the data for each software or maintenance task added by clicking the filter button next to the item's name.
- You can remove an item from the table by clicking the red X button next to the item's name.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/532a234c-7deb-44aa-8097-e1be0465ada6)

- Click the `xlsx` button located at the top-right corner of the table to export the data in the table.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2cc6c4be-09a2-489c-876e-18c8fcdd10b0)

- The excel export will contain an "Overview" worksheet, that provides you the compliancy of the selected software and tasks for each computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/555ff1ca-f2f9-47bd-967b-b7a7ae111e7f)

- For each software and task you have in the table, an additional worksheet will be added that provides you information about the latest action taken.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/8d1bb0b7-ca66-427d-bb27-4d08cdccda76)

#### Restart ImmyBot

---

Added a **Restart ImmyBot** button to the System Status Page. The System Status Page has been moved to the top of the navbar.

_Note_: Only MSP Admin users can see this page.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/830b95ea-9f95-4d35-b878-27de5ddb4303)

#### Get-RmmInstallScript Metascript

---

Exposed new metascript `Get-RmmInstallSCript -RmmLinkId <int>` that will return a script block containing the powershell install script for the specified rmm link. This is was added to provide an quick way to update the ImmyBot Agent on computers. Long term, we will add auto update logic to the ImmyBot Agents so we don't have to do this.

##### Example usage

```powershell
$RmmInfo = Get-RmmInfo -ProviderType ImmybotAgent
$ScriptBlock = Get-RmmInstallScript -RmmLinkId $RmmInfo.RmmLinkId
Invoke-ImmyCommand $ScriptBlock
```

#### Improved Software Detection

---

We expanded the "Software Table" detection method to have three search modes: Contains, Regex, and Traditional.

We added a lookup table that can search the known software on your computers to help create better detection methods.

The **Contains** search mode allows you to target software using a contains search.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2fd1fa6c-7a5a-4e1f-b31b-2a8f25df8c0c)

The **Regex** search mode allows to target software using regular expressions.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/acb119f1-2b67-4ccc-85f4-cb51ed455f93)

The **Traditional** search mode is the old detection style used by ImmyBot. This method is essentially the same as Regex, but replaces occurrences of _ with ._

##### Software Lookup Table

---

The table will show software already installed on your computers that matches the detection method you provide.

We provide the software name, version, upgrade code (if present), and how many computers in your instance have it installed.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/2ae846c2-29e0-4819-8b0e-3d09e3dc5336)

#### Software Repair

---

Added a software repair option to the Software Details Page

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/c399015c-161c-4548-bd83-570ec932248c)

On a computer's software tab, you can now click a repair button that will perform the specified repair logic.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/3a3f0587-0b05-4af0-ac10-bd06e31164b5)

#### Updated the azure dependencies for the Immy Agent

---

#### License Restriction Improvements

---

## 0.36.4

Released 2020-11-19

### Bug Fixes

- Moved the pending reboot check from the beginning of the session to the beginning of the execution phase so computers do not reboot during detection. Computers usually run detection during the day and we do not want to reboot computers while they are being used.

- Fixed issue preventing a computer from rebooting if necessary before it starts a maintenance session
- Fixes an issue where an action would immediately fail if the computer failed to reboot
  - e.g. A software is supposed to be uninstalled and then reinstalled. After the uninstall, a reboot may be attempted. If it fails, we will now still attempt the reinstall anyway.
